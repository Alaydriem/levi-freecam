</div>

A free camera for Minecraft Bedrock, with keyframed camera paths for recording smooth shots in game (for example with OBS). Your player stays where you left it while the camera flies.

Client-side only. Nothing is sent to the server.

## Features

- Fly anywhere with smooth or instant motion, and change speed with the mouse wheel
- Player is frozen while the camera is free
- HUD, hand and crosshair are hidden (<kbd>F1</kbd> brings the HUD back)
- Camera paths: place points, play them back with easing, and lock points onto a block or entity for orbit shots
- Playback bar with rewind, play, a scrubber and point tools
- Screenshots of the freecam view, without the bar or path markers
- Turns itself off when you take damage, die, change dimension, leave the world, or the server takes the camera

## Installation

Requires the client build of [LeviLamina](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) and [Alaydriem's Mod Manager](https://github.com/alaydriem/levi-modmanager).

## FAQ

**Can I use it on servers?** It works anywhere, but some servers don't allow freecam. Check the rules first.

**Why can't I see far away?** The camera only shows chunks the server has sent you.

**Controller support?** No, keyboard and mouse only.

## Building

Requires Windows x64, [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), rustup, [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) and LLVM (`clang-cl`).

```powershell
mise trust
mise run preflight
mise run build-mod
mise run test
```
